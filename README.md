# A Node.js skeleton that makes use of Express, Mongoose and Coffeescript

**This skeleton is still under development and is not finished.**

A skeleton being built around conventions I like using in Node.js development.

Heavily based on @madhums nodejs-express-mongoose-demo but uses Coffeescript
and various other things I've come across on my Node.js journey.

These are some of the packages that have been implemented or will be used 
for this skeleton:

- Coffee-script
- Mongoose
- Connect-mongo
- Connect-assets
- Connect-flash
- Passport.js
- Twitter bootstrap
- Less
- Jade
- Grunt
- node-dev
